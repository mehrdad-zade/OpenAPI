    "makemore has data sets such as 35k names that can be taken as an input into a NN and expect to get new unique names based on the inputs that will \"sound\" like a name.\n",

    "makemore is character level model. meaning that, it takes the list of names and evaluates each name on a character level. this way the model understands the sequence of characters and is able to predict the next char. \n",

    "there are several models for doing so. starting with the old style Bigrams and Bag of words. then moving to RNN and GRU. and finally using the modern Transformer model that is being used in ChatGPT.\n",
